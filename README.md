Collaboration project on Shell. We were tasked to create a simple shell that mimics the Bash shell.
Our shell shall be called hsh.

hsh is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them.
To be compiled using gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
